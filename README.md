In this project a smart energy management system for a living room will be developed using IoT. The suitable way to do so is by using microcontroller i.e. Arduino. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
The user interacts with the system with Arduino without Interface through various sensor-based and automation methods. This ways can be through the;
1.	Motion sensors: The motion sensor when placed in the living room can detect the occupancy and the motion of people. Users can interact by simply moving around the room. For example the System can turn on the lights in the living room if there is a motion detected and it can turn it off while there is no motion detected.
2.	Light sensors: The light sensors measure the ambient light levels in the living room. The light sensors help in reducing the consumption of energy when there is a sufficient daylight.
3.	Temperature Sensors: Users can interact by setting the temperature level, i.e. when the temperature falls below or rise above a certain level, the system can automatically control the cooling or heating devices. Etc.
